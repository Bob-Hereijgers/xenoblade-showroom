              I decided to make this project about Xenoblade Chronicles because
              the third game is coming out this year and I am still obsessed
              with it. But also because it's a series that means a lot to me as
              a person. Ever since I saw a playthrough of the first game in
              2014. Over time my love for the series only grew with every entry,
              this is one of the few series period where I can definetly say
              there are no bad entries whatsoever. I would also like to note
              that I know the styling doesn't look all too good. My fort√© isn't
              really in the front end of things yet, I've got many things to
              learn. While it was a difficult semester for me it was also one I
              learned a lot in. <br /> <br />
